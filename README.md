# student-registration-portal

In the existing Student Registration System, every college follows manual procedure in which the Student collects a Registration form, fills it up, attaches the photocopy of required documents and has to go to various authorities to get approval signatures then submit it by waiting in a queue to the student section. 
This projectâ€™s main idea is to develop an online centralized application connected to database which will maintain all the student related information
